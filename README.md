# ♟️ Chess Move Prediction from Board Images using GPT-4o and PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to:

- Convert FEN positions into images
- Use OpenAI's GPT-4o vision model to predict the best next move from an image
- Evaluate the performance using exact match accuracy and Levenshtein distance
- Optionally build a dataset and model training pipeline using PyTorch
